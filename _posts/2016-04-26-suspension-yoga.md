OmGym(r) Suspension Yoga(tm) is a multi-sensory immersion into enriched postural variation. This method includes a comprehensive mix of grounded and aerial asana that stretches, strengthens, balances, and restores the entire body, especially the core and stabilizing muscles.

Strategic use of the OmGym(r) Suspension System comfortably supports the body to encourage spinal decompression and a deeper exploration of each posture.

Students at all levels discover the "sweet spot" in challenging poses, conquer fears and overcome boundaries, while playfully discovering total body happiness(tm).
